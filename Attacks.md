## What is a Cyber Attack?
**A cyber-attack** is an assault launched by a group of cyber criminals that want to steal money, data, or simply disrupt a company and lead it to suffer financial losses. 
### What do Cyber Attacks target? 
-    Business financial data to steal directly from the business. 
-    Clients lists to steal customers information and sell them on the dark web or use them directly. 
-    Intellectual property to steal the source code of the company and to steal their infrastructure. 
### What are the types of cyber-attacks? 
1.   **Man In The Middle Attack.** 
In this attack, the cybercriminal intercepts the communication line between two business. The two parties think that they are talking on a secure line, but in fact, all the messages are first intercepted by the hacker, then changed into whatever he likes, then sent to the other party. 
Why this is dangerous? 
The hacker can wait for the two parties until they exchange payment information, then he can send his own payment information and steal all the money. This is a very common attack in the crypto world.

2- **Cross Site Scripting (XSS):**
-    They are a type of injection where the attacker sends malicious code usually sent as a browser side script through a user’s input and the output is usually generated without any validation.
-    Usually sent to idiots like Mustafa, where the idiot does not know that the script is actually flawed, and once executed. The attacker can have access to cookies, sessions, tokens or any kind of information retained by the browser.



3- **Cross-site Request forgery (CSRF):**
-    It forces the user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re authenticated, such as sending a link via email or chat.
-    If the user is normal, he will perform requests like sending money or changing their e-mail address.
-    If the user is has an administrative  account,  the attack can compromise the whole web application.

## How to Prevent Different  Attacks in Web Security?

- <span style="color: yellow"> **Keep your system up to date:** </span> Not updating the software regularly makes it weaker and leaves the system more vulnerable to attacks. Hackers take advantage of these flaws, and cybercriminals take advantage of them to get access to your network.

- **Prevent connecting to the public WiFi network:** An unsecured Wi-Fi connection can be used by hackers to spread malware. If you allow file-sharing across a network, a hacker can simply infect your computer with tainted software. The ability of a hacker to put himself between you and the connection point poses the greatest threat to free Wi-Fi security.

- **Install Anti-virus, and update it regularly:** Antivirus software is designed to identify, block, and respond to dangerous software, such as viruses, on your computer. Because computers are continuously threatened by new viruses, it is critical to keep antivirus software up to date. Anti-virus updates include the most recent files required to combat new threats and safeguard your machine. These signature files are provided on a daily basis, if not more frequently.

- **Backup your data:** The fundamental purpose of a data backup is to keep a safe archive of your vital information, whether it’s classified documents for your business or priceless family photos so that you can quickly and effortlessly recover your device in the event of data loss. Backup copies allow data to be restored from a previous point in time, which can aid in the recovery of a business after an unanticipated occurrence. Protecting against primary data loss or corruption requires storing a copy of the data on a secondary medium.

- **Use strong alphanumeric passwords with special characters.**

- **Use HTTPS websites**
- **Make sure you log out after your work is done (like after making a transaction on net banking sites)**

 - **Filter user input:** Sanitize the user’s input when they request some data. You can add a strict filter based on the expected input.

 - **Use proper request/response headers:** The best way to prevent XSS on an HTTP/HTTPS request is to set appropriate headers, like for JSON requests, avoid getting HTML or JS. Use Content-Type:json and same for others.

 - **Encrypt Input/output:** When you encrypt the input and outputs, then there are more chances that a hacker might not understand a user’s data. 

 - **For the first step, use a firewall that blocks unknown requests and files so that users won’t get malware.** Apart from a firewall, you can use IPS or IDP. You should avoid using a VPN because your request is routing through multiple routes, and it may increase the chances for attackers to insert malware. An organizer can prevent access or grant only necessary access to a user. 

 - **Software updates are critical because it involves security.** A new release comes with resolved identified bugs and may have updated securities.

 - **Scan files before use:** When you download any files from the internet or take any files from different hardware, make sure you scan it with an antivirus tool.
 - **Don't Open Danger Or Unknown Emails Or Links**
