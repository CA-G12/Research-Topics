# end to end test

- is a methodology used in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to test the functionality and performance of an application under product-like circumstances and data to replicate live settings

## Tho Goal

- The goal is to simulate what a real user scenario looks like from start to finish. The completion of this testing is not only to validate the system under test, but to also ensure that its sub-systems work and behave as expected.

## why end to end testing

- Software today is becoming more complex. Applications are built on layers and entire networks of sub-systems, including UI and API layers, external databases, networks, and even third-party integrations. When one fails, so does the entire product, making the stability of each component vital to the success of an application. End To End Testing verifies complete system flow and increases confidence by detecting issues and increasing Test Coverage of subsystems. Modern software systems are complex and interconnected with multiple subsystems that may differ from current systems. The whole system can collapse by failure of any subsystem that is major risk which can be avoided by End-to-End testing.

## Benefits of End-To-End Testing

- Confirms Your Application Health: End-to-end testing will validate that your software is functional at every level – from the front to back-end and on multiple systems – as well as provide perspective on its performance across different environments.
- Expands Test Coverage: By incorporating the many different sub systems in your testing process, you’ll effectively expand your test coverage and create additional test cases that may have not previously been considered.
- Detects Bugs & Increases Application Productivity: In end-to-end testing, software is usually tested after every iteration, meaning you’ll be able to find and fix any issues faster. This will reduce the chances of bugs making it further into the testing process (and also production), thereby ensuring the application workflows operate seamlessly.
- Reduces Testing Efforts & Costs: With fewer bugs, breakdowns, and comprehensive testing each step of the way, end-to-end testing will also decrease your need to repeat tests, and ultimately, the costs and time associated with doing so.
