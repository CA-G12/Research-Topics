## What is regression testing?

Regression testing is a software testing practice that ensures an application still functions as expected after any code changes, updates, or improvements.

Regression testing is responsible for the overall stability and functionality of the existing features. Whenever a new modification is added to the code, regression testing is applied to guarantee that after each update, the system stays sustainable under continuous improvements.

Generally, an application goes through multiple tests before the changes are integrated into the main development branch. Regression testing is the final step, as it verifies the product behaviors as a whole.

## When to apply regression testing

Typically, regression testing is applied under these circumstances:

- A new requirement is added to an existing feature
- A new feature or functionality is added
- The codebase is fixed to solve defects
- The source code is optimized to improve performance
- Patch fixes are added
- Changes in configuration

Test automation is a necessary element in software development practices, with regression test, product teams can receive more informative feedback and respond instantly and detects the bugs early.

In other words, if your product undergoes frequent modification, regression testing will be the filter that ensures quality as the product is improved.

## How to perform regression testing

- Detect Changes in the Source Code
Detect the modification and optimization in the source code; then identify the components or modules that were changed.

- Prioritize Those Changes and Product Requirements
Next, prioritize these modifications and product requirements to streamline the testing process with the corresponding test cases and testing tools.

- Determine Entry Point and Entry Criteria
Ensure whether your application meets the preset eligibility before the regression test execution.

- Determine Exit Point
Determine an exit or final point for the required eligibility or minimum conditions set in step three.

- Schedule Tests
Finally, identify all test components and schedule the appropriate time to execute.

## Tools for regression testing

Jest and Selenium

## Difference between integration and regression testing

However, with Regression Testing, we verify that the existing functionality still works after adding a new feature or modifying code; whereas, Integration testing verifies that the new feature or modification is able to operate correctly with all other existing modules.
